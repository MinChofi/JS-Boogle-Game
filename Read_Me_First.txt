Other features for Additional Points:
1. Restart Game button
** I read carefully through the instruction, but I have not found that for each die which face is facing upside. So I made an assumption to randomly select a face to be facing upside.
Refreshing the page or click Button 'Restart Game' will randomly generate a Board that each die is displayed in a random position in the grid, and also with a random face to be facing upside.

2. Highlight selectable dices
**following this rule:
Gameplay involves clicking on dice one by one to build up a word. You can only click on dice that are adjacent to your last selected die and that are not already selected.
Those dices that can be selected are highlighted in bold orange borders.
